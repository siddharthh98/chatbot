How can I save money?,"The easiest way to save money in Thailand is to simply live like a local. Take local buses, eat street food, and drink local beer. The average Thai lives on a less than 7,750 THB per month in Bangkok, and on even less in the country side. If you stay at cheap guesthouses and eat street food, you can spend as little as 335 THB per day."
How is street food in Thailand?,"Speaking of street food, don’t be afraid to eat it. It’s safe sometimes it’s even safer than restaurant food. If it wasn’t, Thai people wouldn’t be packed in the food stalls each day. You’ll find the best of Thailand’s food on the street and it will cost you a fraction of what you pay at a restaurant."
Any advice for me while travelling to Thailand?,"Want to take a cooking class? Go zip-lining? Trek in the jungle? Dive? Wait until you get into Thailand to book anything. Travel agencies are located all over the tourist areas, looking to sell their tours. Time to brush up on your negotiation skills. You’re able to purchase these tours online before you arrive, but you’ll be paying a lot more!"
How are hotels in Thailand?,"Hostels are both an economical and social choice for Thailand. There are tons to chose from, especially in the really touristy areas of Thailand. Bring some earplugs and prepare to save a lot of money!"
